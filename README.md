# Top Trumps Project
This project was created by myself as a final project to pass the Intro to Python & Apps kickstarter course provided by Code First Girls.


## Requirement
The requirement was to create a programme to simulate a game of Top Trumps using an API (Pokemon in this case) as a data source.  I have included details of the specific requirements identified below.
### Must have:
+ Must generate a random number between 1-151 to generate a Pokemon ID.
+ Must use the 'Pokemon API' to get the details of a Pokemon based on its randomly generated ID, for both player and computer.
+ Must create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name and 2 stat's for the game.
+ Must ask the player to choose a stat to play.
+ Must compare the player's stat to the computer's and decide an overall winner.

### Should have:
+ Should provide 3 different Pokemon for the player to choose from.
+ Should provide 3 different stats for the player to choose from.
+ Should have 3 rounds in each game with an overall winner declared at the end.

### Could have:
+ Could have code to prevent input errors.

### Would have:
+ Would have code to enable the computer to choose a stat based on which one had a better chance of winning, rather than choosing at random.


## Result
The programme in its current state meets all of the must, should and could have requirements listed above.  The 'would have' requirement is still being worked on.
